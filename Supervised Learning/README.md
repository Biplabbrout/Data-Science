# Supervised Learning – Machine Learning Models

This folder contains hands-on implementations of various **Supervised Machine Learning algorithms** using Python and scikit-learn.

## 📂 Models Implemented

### 🔢 Regression:
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor

### 🧮 Classification:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC
- Regression: R² Score, MAE, RMSE

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this mini-project is to:
- Understand and apply core supervised learning models
- Visualize decision boundaries and fit
- Evaluate performance using appropriate metrics
