# 🧠 Data Science Roadmap

Welcome to the Data Science Roadmap! This guide outlines the essential steps and skills required to become a proficient Data Scientist. 
Whether you're just starting out or looking to strengthen your foundation, follow these steps to build a successful data science career.

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Roadmap

### 1. 📥 Gather Data
- Identify data sources (CSV, APIs, Databases, Web Scraping)
- Understand data formats (structured vs unstructured)
- Tools: Excel, SQL, Python (Pandas, Requests, BeautifulSoup)

### 2. 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values
- Encoding categorical variables (Label, One-Hot, Ordinal)
- Normalize/Standardize features
- Tools: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)

### 3. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize distributions and relationships
- Identify outliers and patterns
- Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

### 4. ✂️ Feature Selection & Engineering
- Select important features (Forward/Backward Selection)
- Create new meaningful features
- Tools: Scikit-learn, Featuretools

### 5. 🧠 Model Building
- Train models (Classification, Regression, Clustering)
- Use techniques like cross-validation
- Tools: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM

### 6. 📈 Model Evaluation
- Evaluate with metrics (Accuracy, RMSE, F1-Score)
- Tune hyperparameters
- Tools: Scikit-learn, Optuna, GridSearchCV

### 7. 🚀 Model Deployment
- Deploy using Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit
- Use cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS, GCP)
- Containerize with Docker

### 8. 📦 Maintain & Monitor
- Track model performance in production
- Retrain models as needed
- Tools: MLflow, Airflow, Prometheus
